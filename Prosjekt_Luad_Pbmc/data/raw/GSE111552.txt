!Sample_description = Fasting blood samples were withdrawn at baseline and after the 18-weeks exercise training protocol, 48 hours after the last exercise session
!Sample_data_processing = The raw data were preprocessed in Expression Console (Affymetrix). RMA algorithm was used. Only transcripts that had detection above background with p≤0.05 and were expressed in ≥25% of arrays in both conditions (pre- and post-training) were selected for further analysis. Overall, 49372 to 62620 out of 67539 transcripts represented on the arrays met these criteria. Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC, Affymetrix) was used for this step.  Differentially expressed transcripts in response to exercise training were identified in TAC using ANOVA, with FDR method. When no transcript reached a significance q value of 0.05 in the FDR test, only transcripts with P<0.05 (ANOVA) and fold change (FC) above ±1.5 were retained.
